Two floors of food is always appealing, no less here than anywhere else, but what I love especially about this establishment is its sunken lower floor and proximity to one of SG&rsquo;s coolest old-school buildings.

And then, behold! Golden Mile Complex, which is across the street (overhead walkway provided!) from the food centre. What a neat building. It&rsquo;s Singapore&rsquo;s Little Thailand, which is awesome, and Beer Thai (yup, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called) is wonderful, but the building itself is the best part.

      "description": "<b>Geylang Serai</b><br><i>1 Geylang Serai, 402001</i><hr>Of all the Singapore foods I miss terribly, I think it&rsquo;s nasi padang that I long for most intensely. I concur that <b>Hajjah Mona Nasi Padang #02-166</b> is excellent. But&#8230;<br><br><b>Sinar Pagi Nasi Padang #02-137</b> is my absolute favourite. Their stall sign says &ldquo;Bukit Tinggi &ndash; Kapau&rdquo;: nasi kapau is the particular brand of nasi padang in Bukit Tinggi, Sumatra, where a woman stands in the middle of a step-pyramid of food and uses an extremely long-handled spoon to scoop up your foods (search nasi kapau right now if want a sweet visual). Diners sit at the base of the pyramid and contemplate all of the delicious things that they&rsquo;ll order when they come back for lunch #2 in a few hours. I&rsquo;ve had nasi kapau in Bukit Tinggi, and it&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s no better than Sinar Pagi, ladies and gentlemen. Come for an early lunch so that there&rsquo;s not even the slimmest chance that they&rsquo;ll have run out of their three or four scrumptious sambals, all of which are much more flavourful than they are hot. Order the jackfruit curry. And the sweet potato leaves. And, of course, the rendang, the beef lung, and the stinky stinky petai!! Make sure that the curries and sambals swirl together and merge on your plate. Eat with your hand. Pair it with teh and away you go to a technicolour flavour fantasy land.",
